#  iOS application
I used SwiftUI and the MVVM pattern for this app. Itâ€™s my first time using Swift, so this is my best attempt.
- All the models and view models are in the ViewModels.swift file.
- The remaining files are for the UI. I didn't create separate folders since there are only four files in total.
- I adjusted the title position slightly lower to accommodate the dynamic island (safe area) on iPhones.
- It was not mentioned in the mockup, so I bolded the opening hours for current day
- You might need to sign to run the app
